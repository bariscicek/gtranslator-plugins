gtranslator-plugins
-------------------

This project aims to hold collection of useful, additional plugins to 
gtranslator (gtranslator.sourceforge.net). 

List of current plugins:
* punctuation: Checks the last character of translations so as to compare 
them for punctuation equality (ie. both strings ends with dot etc.) It has 
extra features such as ignoring tags and detecting three dots.

* spell: Spell check current translation and whole po file using enchant 
spell checking library similar to gedit. 

How to install
--------------

You need to use autoreconf first in order to prepare necessary autoconf 
files. What needs to be done in order is following:

$ autoreconf
$ ./configure --with-all-plugins
$ make
# make install
